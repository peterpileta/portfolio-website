    <div id="name">Peter Pileta</div>
    <br>
    <div>My name is Peter Pileta, and IÂ´m 28 years old. I was born in Spain and my parents brought me to the United States when I was a little kid. I lived in New York for 5 years and moved to Florida in 2015. I currently work in a warehouse for a roofing company. My favorite hobbies are programming, binge-watching series, and playing video games.</div>
    <br>
    <div>I knew from a young age that I wanted to work in the IT field. This early interest stimulated my innate curiosity and analytical mind, qualities that are essential for a software developer. My journey as a programmer has been marked by continuous learning and innovation, driven by the same enthusiasm that captivated me as a kid.</div>
